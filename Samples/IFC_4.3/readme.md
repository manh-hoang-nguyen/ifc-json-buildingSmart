## FAQ

### I don't know how to use `markdown`.

Please see [markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
Any text editor will do,
 or use one of the free online editors (e.g. [markdown-it](https://markdown-it.github.io/)).

### I wish to participate with my own example files.

Take note of the readme files and submit a pull request.
Contact `technical@buildingsmart.org` or `infrastructure@buildingsmart.org` (depending on the type of file) for help.
